## GOGO Rides

- The frontend is built with Next.js 14 and Shadcn UI.
- For authentication, I used Firebase.
- For tables, I used a combination of Shadcn UI and Tanstack tables.
- The backend is built with Next.js server actions and Mongoose for database management.
- The site is currently deployed on Vercel.
